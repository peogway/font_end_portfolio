This project is about creating a front-end webpage for my portfolio.
Some features are created by the core Scss/CSS and CSS Grid: Roatating Menu Button, Menu Overlay, and Responsive Image Slideshow.
You can easily use the project by download the codebase, then open any html files in dist folder.
I have also deployed my website with Github Pages. You can look through it by this link:
